# Instructions for installing and launching a Telegram bot for data analytics

## Description
This Telegram bot is designed to collect and analyze data (sales statistics, user activity) and generate reports. The bot works with an SQLite database and can create graphs and CSV files.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8 or 3.9 (NOT 3.11 or 3.12, as these versions may have dependency issues)
- Internet access
- Telegram account

## Getting a token for a bot
Before installing and launching the bot, you need to get an API token. For this:

1. Open Telegram and find the bot @BotFather
2. Send him the command `/newbot`
3. Follow the instructions of BotFather: specify the name of the bot and its username (must end with "bot")
4. After creating the bot, BotFather will send you an API token - a long string like `123456789:ABCDefGhIJKlmNoPQRsTUVwxyZ`
5. Save this token - you will need it when setting up the bot.

## Install and run on Windows

### Step 1: Install Python
1. Download Python 3.9 from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3913/
   - Scroll down and select "Windows installer (64-bit)" or "Windows installer (32-bit)" depending on your system
2. Run the downloaded file
3. **IMPORTANT**: Check the box "Add Python 3.9 to PATH" before installing
4. Click "Install Now"

### Step 2: Download and prepare the bot files
1. Create a folder for the bot on your computer, for example, `C:\TelegramBot `
2. Copy the bot file `main.py ` to this folder

### Step 3: Open the Command Prompt
1. Press the `Win + R` keys on the keyboard
2. Type `cmd` and press Enter
3. In the command prompt that opens, navigate to the created folder with the bot:
``
cd C:\TelegramBot
```

### Step 4: Create a virtual environment and install dependencies
1. Create a virtual environment by typing in the command line:
``
python -m venv venv
```

2. Activate the virtual environment:
```
venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install the necessary libraries:
``
pip install aiogram==3.0.0 pandas matplotlib
``

### Step 5: Change the token in the file
1. Open the file `main.py ` using any text editor (for example, Notepad)
2. Find the string: `API_TOKEN = 'YOUR_TOKEN_ARI'
3. Replace 'YOUR_TOKEN_ARI' with the token received from BotFather (without removing the quotes)
4. Save the file

### Step 6: Launch the Bot
1. At the command prompt (with the virtual environment enabled), type:
``
python main.py
``
2. If everything is installed correctly, you will see a message about the launch of the bot.
3. Now you can open Telegram and start a dialogue with your bot.

### Stopping the bot
To stop the bot, press the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+C` in the command prompt.

## Install and run on Linux

### Step 1: Install Python and the necessary tools
Open a terminal and run the following commands:

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3.9 python3.9-venv python3-pip git
```

### Step 2: Create a folder for the bot and upload the files
``
mkdir~/telegrambot
cd~/telegrambot
```

Copy the bot file `main.py `to this folder.

### Step 3: Create a virtual environment and install dependencies
```
python3.9 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install aiogram==3.0.0 pandas matplotlib
```

### Step 4: Change the token in the file
1. Open the main file.py in the text editor:
``
nano main.py
```
2. Find the line: `API_TOKEN = 'YOUR_TOKEN_ARI'
3. Replace 'YOUR_TOKEN_ARI' with the token received from BotFather (without removing the quotes)
4. Save the file by pressing `Ctrl+O`, then `Enter`, then `Ctrl+X`

### Step 5: Launch the Bot
```
python3 main.py
```

### Step 6: Setting up Autorun (optional)
To keep the bot running after closing the terminal, you can use the `screen`:

1. Install screen:
```
sudo apt install screen
```

2. Create a new screen session:
```
screen -S telegrambot
```

3. Activate the virtual environment and launch the bot:
```
cd ~/telegrambot
source venv/bin/activate
python3 main.py
```

4. Press `Ctrl+A', then `D` to disconnect from the session (the bot will continue to work)

5. To return to the bot session:
``
screen -r telegrambot
```

## Using a bot

After launching the bot, you can interact with it in Telegram using the following commands:

- `/start' - Getting started, displays a welcome message and basic commands
- `/report` - Creating a report (on sales or user activity)
- `/stats` - Viewing statistics for the selected period

On the first launch, the bot will automatically create an SQLite database and fill it with test data for demonstration.

## Possible problems and their solutions

### Windows: "Python is not an internal or external command..."
- Reinstall Python by making sure to check the box "Add Python to PATH"

### Linux: "Command python3 not found"
- Try using the command `python3.9` instead of `python3`

### Library installation error
- Try to update pip before installation: `pip install --upgrade pip`
- If there is a problem with matplotlib, install the system dependencies (for Linux):
``
  sudo apt-get install python3-dev libfreetype6-dev
  ```

### Error when launching the bot
- Make sure that the API token is specified correctly in the file `main.py `
- Check your internet connection
- Make sure that all libraries are installed correctly

## Additional information

This bot uses:
- aiogram 3.0.0 - for interacting with the Telegram API
- pandas - for data analysis
- matplotlib - for plotting
- SQLite - for data storage
